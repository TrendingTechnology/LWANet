   LWANet can segment surgical instruments in real-time while takes little computational costs. Based on 960Ã—544 inputs, its inference speed can reach 39 fps with only 3.39 GFLOPs. Also, it has a small model size and the number of parameters is only 2.06 M. The proposed network is evaluated on two datasets. It achieves state-of-the-art performance 94.10% mean IOU on Cata7 and obtains a new record on EndoVis 2017 with a 4.10% increase on mean IOU.
